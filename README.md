# Tweet-Emotion-Recognizer
This project uses a recurrent neural network and trains it on a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain that I have attempted to solve using Tensorflow.
